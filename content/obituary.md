43 of Fox Chapel, formerly of San Francisco, CA; Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, GA; and Jacksonville, FL passed away on Monday, October 15, 2018. She is survived by her beloved husband, Matthew James Harris; sons Apollo and Orion Li Harris; parents, Ernest Shing Li and Mei Ewa Pan Li; and sister, Amy Sang-Yng Li.

Cindy was born Sang-Ching Li 李上卿 in Taiwan on September 5, 1975. Cindy’s family came to the United States in 1980 and they settled in Jacksonville, Florida in 1981. Cindy excelled in her studies at the University of Florida and graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. Her first project saw her moving to Atlanta, GA to typeset the 1996 Olympics Centennial Wall. This started Cindy’s impressive career as a pioneer visual, accessibility, and user experience designer, working on products and services for AOL.com, Move.com, and Yahoo!, including being the lead designer for the relaunch of Flickr for iOS in 2012.

Cindy was a devoted and joyful wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend. She met her future husband, Matt, at a professional conference and skiing trip in Vancouver in 2007, that she helped organize. They hit it off over Buckley’s cough syrup and were married in 2009, and again in 2010. Cindy and Matt have two sons: Apollo, age 4, born in 2014 and Orion, age 2, born in 2016.

Cindy’s life was an amazing journey and she made every moment an adventure. She had boundless energy and made everything around her extraordinary.

Cindy loved making ornate and challenging costumes and decorations, turning birthday parties into magical worlds for both kids and adults. She loved cooking and was fearless in trying new things – think soy milk from scratch or marshmallow fondant. She could Lindy hop the night away, flips and all. Most of all she cared about the people and world around her. She had a magic ability to bring out laughter and joy, even in the most difficult moments. Cindy was selfless and an inspiration to all who knew her.

Throughout her life she was a friend to all, and those relationships grew into an international cadre of friends who think the world of her. She had an uncanny ability to bring together people from all walks of life. The friendship she provided each person acted as a strong bond which immediately connected everyone together. This was most evident in the last years of her life, when the gaggle of friends she’d made over the years all came together to bring comfort and support to her, Matt, and the children. She will be missed by so many.

Services and interment are being held privately. A memorial service for her many friends and family members will be held at a later date. Cindy wanted to ensure the security of her children’s education and has requested any gifts or contributions people wish to send be made as contributions to Apollo and Orion’s education savings accounts.
