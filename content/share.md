Everyone loved Cindy and I've been floored by the response to the call for memories and photos.

If you'd like to share a story and/or photo, there are a few ways to do it:

* Send an email to [kevin@lawver.net](mailto:kevin@lawver.net) with your story and photos and I'll post it for you.
* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/kplawver/cindy_is_awesome/issues/new) with the story and photo and I'll add it.
* Create a [pull request](https://github.com/kplawver/cindy_is_awesome/) with your post added. I'll merge it and deploy it.
