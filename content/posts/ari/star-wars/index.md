  title: Cindy's costume was the star of the bunch, but we all got quite a workout that morning. Chris's Chewbacca was almost as popular, I think because he has the height to carry it off well.

Christoper spent years trying to convince Cindy to bring her infamous handmade Queen Amidala costume to Comic-Con. He had seen the costume in person and knew it would be a big hit. There was a LOT of convincing to be done, though—the costume itself takes up a whole large suitcase, plus the headdress takes up a separate box, plus the hair & make-up, etc.

Finally, we got to spend some time with Cindy and Matt at the Penn State Conference for .edu professionals, and they were thinking the upcoming Comic-Con might be their last before starting a family. We struck a deal: Cindy would only bring/wear the Amidala costume to Comic-con 2013 if ALL OF US dressed up, preferably as Star Wars characters. We picked a friday morning to show up at the Expo floor in all of our gear—Matt as Anakin, Chris as Chewy, Me as Leia, Cindy as THE QUEEN—and were instantly mobbed for photos (in a good way). We couldn't take more than 3 steps [without someone asking for a photo](https://www.popsugar.com/tech/photo-gallery/31010914/image/31036233/hair-makeup-Queen-Amidala-cosplayer-stunning)!
