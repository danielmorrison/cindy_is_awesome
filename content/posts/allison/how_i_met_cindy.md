Over 30 years ago, I met the one and only Cindy  Li.  She was one of my first friends at a new school.  And if you guessed we met in an art class...then you are correct.  I was truly in awe of her talent.  And the ideas that would just come to her...we have all witnessed that.

I remember going to one of her birthday parties at her parents restaurant.   That was my introduction to her family...and some of the best food!!  Through good times and bad times....I knew Cindy would have my back....and call me at 12;01 on my birthday. ðŸ˜‚
