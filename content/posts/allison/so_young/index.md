  title: Cindy was one of my first friends at Stanton.  And this friendship has stood the test of time.  I remember this trip to Epcot.  Cindy wanted to get a picture in every single "country".  I wasn't big in getting my picture taken sometimes, but she made sure that we had some great memories.  And the pictures sure do prove this was a great memory.
