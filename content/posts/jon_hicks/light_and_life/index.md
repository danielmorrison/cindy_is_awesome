In our industry you meet a lot of nice people, but sometimes you meet the ones who are truly exceptional with a heart to match.  At a memorable SXSW in 2005, I first met Glenda Sims, Jennifer Hanen and… Cindy Li. It was like meeting was light and life together.

A great example of this exceptional heart which I’ve never forgotten, was when I couldn’t attend SXSW in 2007. Cindy and Glenda created ‘Flat Hicks’, and I was able to attend in proxy, being passed around attendees, but spending most of ‘my’ time tucked into Cindy’s fabulous top hat.  It was truly touching to see all the photos being posted of his adventures, and that people would care enough.

I’ve never mentioned this to anyone, but I should confess that I’m extremely jealous of her top level cosplay abilities. Having a beard and glasses really limits what you can do (apart from Porkins from A New Hope?). No such obstacle for you Cindy, but you went way beyond and truly became Amidala, Baroness and the list goes on.

You’re truly incredible Cindy, much love and cheese from the Cotswolds! x
