My favorite story about our time together, is not something we did for one another, but what we did for your pops. I mean, eating Franklin's BBQ with Arun, Matt, Ben, etc. on that Austin hotel balcony is up there. No doubt. But, the two us coordinating that FaceTime call with your pops during the Warriors championship game 5 is my favorite because it brought your father joy.

Joy is what you bring to us. You are amazing, graceful and stylish. Thank you for being our friend, and for all the joy you bring to our lives.
