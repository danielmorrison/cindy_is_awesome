In September of 2012, I visited San Francisco for a conference and spent an afternoon of drinking wine with Matt and having dinner with them at Morimoto's in Napa Valley. It was awesome and they were both amazing people to hang out with. I caught this photo after we ate some ice cream. They are still very cool people.
