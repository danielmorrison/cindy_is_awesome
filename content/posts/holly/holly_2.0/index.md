One of my favorite memories is meeting her and thinking oh man if I had 1/10 of her energy I could be sooooo much better!!!

She is Holly 2.0!!! :stuck_out_tongue: My aspiring next version.

When I met Cindy in her cube, I knew I had found my East coast tribe! I always had a friend when I went to Dulles who would always take me in no matter how old of a version of Holly I was :wink:
