Hi Cindy! This is Manny! I heard that you and your family are going through a trying time right now and I want you to know that Iâ€™m wishing the best thoughts that I can muster all the way from the west coast. You have always been a cheerful shining positive ray of light when we worked together back in the Flickr days and I always appreciated that. Thinking of you. :heart:  -Manny
