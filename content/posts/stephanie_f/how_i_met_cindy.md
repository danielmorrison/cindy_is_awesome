Iâ€™m way late adding to this, I think I first met Cindy when she came to stay with us for dconstruct. We got chatting about crafts etc and hit it off. We stayed in touch and saw each other when we were traveling for conferences etc. She supported me through a rough break up, and asked all the right questions when I met someone new! We just kinda never stopped chatting and whenever we were nearby weâ€™d meet up and it was like weâ€™d always been hanging out.

Then we both found ourselves with kids and up all the hours and the time difference was actually less of a problem for a while ðŸ˜‚

Cindy I can trust you completely and know youâ€™d have my back, no matter what. The most kind, caring and giving person I know!
