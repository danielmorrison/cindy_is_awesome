One of my favorite moments was actually before we actually officially met! AOL HQ, 2000-2001ish. Going down the looooooooooong hallway, a person glided/levitated past me. Smile, ear to ear. I look :eyes: ed down at your sneakers Cindy, still baffled. With the wink of an eye and a flip of your shoe, you revealed your heelyâ€™s :D  Magic! It was Love at first sight
