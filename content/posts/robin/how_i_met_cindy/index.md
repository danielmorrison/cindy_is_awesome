I remember how I met Cindy! I haven't known her as long as most of you. Joshua had worked with her at Flickr and was currently working with Matt at Twitter, and we were living in Berkeley while I was on sabbatical. I had given birth like a month before Cindy did, and I was standing awkwardly in a queue waiting to get in to Twitter for their Halloween party with a stroller full of a 3 month old baby. I normally live in Wisconsin and had no idea what was happening. Cindy ran up to me, introduced herself (I knew no one else) and we spent a giant chunk of the following year figuring out how to raise babies together. Cal Academy of Sciences featured *heavily* once we learned both Apollo and Mathison would go right to sleep in the giant fish room. I have never been so grateful that someone took me under their wing to help me navigate life!
