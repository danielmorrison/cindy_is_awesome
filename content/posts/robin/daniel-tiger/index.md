I don't think I've posted this one yet - Joshua and I went out to visit in June 2016- Cindy is hiding behind Apollo's stroller because she didn't want anyone to really know she was pregnant yet, so she didn't even want me to post these photos at the time even though she's well hidden. Apollo and Mathison had so much fun at the Daniel Tiger exhibit at the children's museum, and it prompted so many Cindy/Mr. Rogers stories to be told. :heart:
