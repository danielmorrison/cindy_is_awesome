Dear Cindy,

I want to thank you for the good times we shared in the Flickr offices and outside of them. Your expertise in UX design has always been very inspirational for me when we worked together, and I still remember the day when we had that little talk about Veerle from the Netherlands and about how much I enjoy her blog, to which you just responded that you are actually friends.

It was a very nice surprise.

You are a truly creative mind which shows in everything you share with us, your friends from around the world, especially your talent for crafting the most wonderful costumes and toys for the boys (and yourself).

Sending many positive thoughts your way!
Kay
