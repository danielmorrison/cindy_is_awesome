Back in 2008, a bunch of people most of whom didn't know each other very well got together on Alderney and built (the now sadly long-departed) Wildlife Near You. A month or so later, Matt & Cindy came to London, and a few of us went to London Zoo. This is the most fun photo I have from that trip (I have no idea why they had a crazy mirror at the zoo!), and I'll add another couple in a moment.
