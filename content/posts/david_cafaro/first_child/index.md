Adding another fun Cindy moment that I will always remember.  Not long after we had our first child Cindy came to visit with her fancy DSLR camera and took amazing pictures of my wife and I and our new son, but the one picture that always stood out in my memory was the one picture I took with her camera, not so much the camera skill (cause I had no clue what I was doing and got the framing off) but the joy and smiles it captured in my son's face looking at Cindy's incredible smile.
