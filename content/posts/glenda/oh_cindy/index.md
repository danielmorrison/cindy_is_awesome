Oh Cindy,

So many firsts. We first met at SXSW 2005. What a magical year. SX was still small enough that we could run into each other in the halls...but large enough that it was easy to feel lost in the crowd. You helped create our home away from home at the Austin Downtown Hampton Inn. The lounge area on the second floor became our “living room”. We’d gather together there just like family.

Remember all the fun we had playing in the Lego Pit, hanging out at Ms. Jen’s Wine & Cheese Party, taking Flat Hicks to panels and parties, celebrating at the Media Temple Closing Parties, being silly at Geeks Love Bowling, being a part of the very first Blue Beanie Day, wearing the Geeks Love * t-shirt you created, taking field trips to the Salt Lick BBQ, staying up all night and then heading to breakfast at IHOP (on the last night of SXSW so we wouldn’t miss a minute of the fun) and making oh so very many fish faces.

We weren’t just geeks attending a conference together...it felt like we were going to high school or college together. What an amazing adventure we shared learning, playing and creating goodness on the web.

As I look back at how our friendship started more than a decade ago...I can see that knowing you has made an impact on my heart, mind and soul for good.

I love you Cindy Li…to Infinity & Beyond,
Glenda
