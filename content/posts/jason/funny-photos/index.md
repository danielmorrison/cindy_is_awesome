Took this photo in a swank neighborhood in Los Gatos at the end of our cross-country drive to move Cindy to San Francisco. There was some coding event going on at this rented house and we popped by on Tantek’s invitation (if memory serves).

We didn’t know anyone, didn’t have laptops, and spent the afternoon hanging around this strange house in a strange place talking to strange people. So, natch, we took funny photos.
