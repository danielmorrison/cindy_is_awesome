[Jessica](/tags/jessica) just shared a Hello Kitty holding `<li>`, but I wanted to share something from my daughter tonight.

When I told my daughter, now 12, about Cindy, she brought out the Hello Kitty Cindy and Matt brought her for her 6th birthday, and that she sleeps with every night since then.

Hello Kitty from Cindy & Matt for daughter on her 6th B-day in 2012, brought back from Japan.

All she could say was "Kitty is sad tonight like the rest of us" :cry:
