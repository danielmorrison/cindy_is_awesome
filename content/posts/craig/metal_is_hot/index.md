  title: Before the bowling event at SXSW 2008 we spent a day making gold, silver, and bronze "medals" out of floppy disks and were using little chain links as hangers, and solder to close the links because there was still a little gap and the ribbon could slip through. In hindsight we should have used epoxy or something, but whatever. So we had been resting the soldering iron on a wrench to keep it off the table and at some point I picked up the wrench and it was crazy-hot because a soldering iron had been resting on it for an hour. I quickly dropped it and said "oh right, metal is a conductor of heat" and that got a big laugh. That became something of a catch phrase, and it was not the only time that day we forgot that hot things are hot.
