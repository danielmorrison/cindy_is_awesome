  title: I was writing a book on HTML. Such books have lots of code examples, and to make a dry subject more amusing I went with a superhero theme. Specifically an imaginary website for a superhero supply company (power-outfitters.com). For a few examples I needed some photos of superheroes, and obviously couldn't use any trademarked characters or copyrighted images. So… who do I know who is highly photogenic and willing to wear a silly costume…

  title: I got a Green Lantern mask at Toys R Us (this was when the movie had just come out, but we'll not mention it again) and painted it with acrylics. She used her Queen of Hearts coat and they matched nicely.
