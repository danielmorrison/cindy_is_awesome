Hi Cindy Li, sweet as can be.

I'm very sad to hear about your cancer. I just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you and that I've often thought about you over the years. I still remember when we first met and someone showed me photos of one of the costumes you made (I think the Tron one) and I was like, "She MADE that!?" and then you just kept making other amaze stuff and being great at work and being the kind of sweet and wonderful person you are. I don't list these wonderful things just to list wonderful things, but because it's that combo that makes me think about you. I always related to you because the sweet, kind and excited demeanor we share. But I always questioned my own ability to make things or their value if it's just cause I think it's fun, but that combo in you always helps me. Basically this is my clumsy way of saying I appreciate your joy and creativity, it inspires me and always will.

All my love to you and Matt and the kids,
~Zack
