Photo I took of Cindy and Matt at 2013 Nerd HQ at San Diego ComicCon. Cindy I know has always wanted to make it back, and while I have so  many  memories with them at conferences, staying with them in the bay, and the trip  they, my wife and I took  to Vegas, with them. ComicCon has always been so special to them both, and my memories with them there are really special too.
