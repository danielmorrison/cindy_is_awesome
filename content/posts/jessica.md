Swans and birthday: Cindy and I grew up going to the same French pastry shop (DeNoels’) in St. Augustine, Florida, where they made they best cream-filled swans. We’ve often laughed about how we probably saw each other in there as kids but never realized it. In 2005 we finally went to the shop together for the first time - and ordered swans, of course. And when Jeremy and I visited Cindy and Matt in Pittsburgh in 2017, we spent a good two days following a recipe from the Bouchon Bakery cookbook to recreate the swans. They turned out amazing! On that same trip to Pittsburgh, Cindy and I cooked the lobster mac and cheese recipe from the French Laundry cookbook for Jeremy’s birthday dinner, and Jeremy posed with Cindy, wearing Cindy’s balloon creation on his head. It was a wonderful few days of baking and cooking and just having fun.

Our friendship pretty much started with food. Not long after I met Cindy in 2005, we got fish and chips near the Tower of London, and a seagull pooped on the tray before we started eating. Cindy didn’t have much luck with seagulls on that trip to the UK - she had already gotten pooped on once before this!

We hung out at SxSW in 2006 (as sultry cowgirls). I remember this SxSW so clearly, not just because it was my first, but because I recall standing in the hallway of the convention center feeling totally lost and overwhelmed, and Cindy took me under wing and made sure I was okay. It was classic Cindy - selfless, warm and funny, always caring for others. I’m forever grateful to her for looking out for me that year. Jeremy, meanwhile, was the little devil on her shoulder!

In 2007, Jeremy posed for a slightly unsettling picture wearing Cindy’s stunning Amidala headdress. He also went to Web Directions North in Canada, and when he came back, he told me that Cindy and a guy named Matt Harris had been bonding over cough medicine. And the rest is history…

In 2008, we took Cindy and Matt to the weirdest, most stressful tea shop in Brighton, the Tea Cosy, where everything is decorated with pictures of the Royal Family, you’re not allowed to use your mobile phone, and you’re not supposed to speak at a volume louder than the clink of a teaspoon against a cup. And Cindy tried (and failed) to sneakily give me bunny ears at Barcamp Brighton. Also in 2008, Jeremy and Matt dueled with balloon sword’s at Norm’s wedding, and two years later Cindy and I duelled as Iron Cindy and Boba Jess. I guess we have a dueling thing.

When Jeremy officiated Wed 2.0 in 2010, he was more nervous than I’d ever seen him. He used CSS to make a little fold-up booklet of everything he was supposed to say during the ceremony. He only went off-script once: “If any of you know any reason why these two should not be wed - you’re too late!” And Cindy dropped the ring, which plinky-plonked across the floor and cracked everyone up even more.

The following year, we got to go to the French Laundry with Cindy and Matt and my brother and sister-in-law. Cindy drove us all out to Napa, where we visited a winery before heading to the restaurant. It was an epic, glorious, unforgettable meal, and it included a huge truffle in a fancy box that we all got to admire before it was sprinkled all over our food. We’ve had a *lot* of amazing meals with Cindy and Matt, but I don’t think any of them could top the French Laundry.

Also in 2011, Cindy and Matt were in Brighton for dConstruct, and Cindy and I made use of the photobooth, where we were supposed to make happy, sad, angry and scared faces. This photo never fails make me laugh.

And in 2014, we got to meet Apollo! I remember Cindy surprising me with the news that she was having a baby. We were in Boston for a conference, and on the first day she was oddly insistent that I come down to the hotel lobby and say hi to her before going to breakfast. So I went down, and when I stepped out of the elevator, there she was, visibly pregnant and looking *so* happy. Apollo and Orion have brought Matt and Cindy so much joy. They’ve made such a beautiful family together, and we love them all so much.
