I have an awful lot of fun images of Cindy. Mostly taken in Austin, because we mostly met up at SXSW. And ate steak. But this is the one I’m feeling the most right now. She came over to London for my wedding. We had a children’s entertainer making balloon animals but obviously OBVIOUSLY the big kids in the room got things too. I got a pirate sword for example. And Cindy, well, Cindy got wings.
