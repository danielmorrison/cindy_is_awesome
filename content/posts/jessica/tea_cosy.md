In 2008, we took Cindy and Matt to the weirdest, most stressful tea shop in Brighton, the Tea Cosy, where everything is decorated with pictures of the Royal Family, you’re not allowed to use your mobile phone, and you’re not supposed to speak at a volume louder than the clink of a teaspoon against a cup. And Cindy tried (and failed) to sneakily give me bunny ears at Barcamp Brighton. Also in 2008, Jeremy and Matt dueled with balloon sword’s at Norm’s wedding, and two years later Cindy and I duelled as Iron Cindy and Boba Jess. I guess we have a dueling thing.
