And in 2014, we got to meet Apollo! I remember Cindy surprising me with the news that she was having a baby. We were in Boston for a conference, and on the first day she was oddly insistent that I come down to the hotel lobby and say hi to her before going to breakfast. So I went down, and when I stepped out of the elevator, there she was, visibly pregnant and looking *so* happy. Apollo and Orion have brought Matt and Cindy so much joy. Theyâ€™ve made such a beautiful family together, and we love them all so much.
