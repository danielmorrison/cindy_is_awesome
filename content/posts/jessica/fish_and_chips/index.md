  title: Our friendship pretty much started with food. Not long after I met Cindy in 2005, we got fish and chips near the Tower of London, and a seagull pooped on the tray before we started eating. Cindy didnâ€™t have much luck with seagulls on that trip to the UK - she had already gotten pooped on once before this!
