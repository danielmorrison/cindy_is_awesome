We hung out at SxSW in 2006 (as sultry cowgirls). I remember this SxSW so clearly, not just because it was my first, but because I recall standing in the hallway of the convention center feeling totally lost and overwhelmed, and Cindy took me under wing and made sure I was okay. It was classic Cindy - selfless, warm and funny, always caring for others. Iâ€™m forever grateful to her for looking out for me that year. Jeremy, meanwhile, was the little devil on her shoulder!
