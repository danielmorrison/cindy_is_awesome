When Jeremy officiated Wed 2.0 in 2010, he was more nervous than I’d ever seen him. He used CSS to make a little fold-up booklet of everything he was supposed to say during the ceremony. He only went off-script once: “If any of you know any reason why these two should not be wed - you’re too late!” And Cindy dropped the ring, which plinky-plonked across the floor and cracked everyone up even more.
