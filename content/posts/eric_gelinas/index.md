Cindy,

I have been hoping to share this with you for a long time. It’s hard to know exactly how to thank somebody for this sort of thing. When I met you at Flickr, you confronted me about the culture of dirty jokes and frat boy pranks I was a part of encouraging on the team. For a variety of reasons, I could not appreciate the courage and wisdom it took to confront me about that. I couldn’t give you the satisfaction in the moment of respecting your feedback. I want you to know that years later I got it. I still bring levity and joy to my work, but only in a way that gives others the opportunity to also bring joy to their work. If I see somebody acting like as jackass at the expense of somebody else, I will always speak up. I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate that.

Eric
