I am realizing how few photos I took of Cindy - I think because she was always the one with the camera (and always a better camera than what I had!) I’ve been looking through her flickr feed and realizing how much I *love* these photos of the two of us. Cindy’s wearing a crown of course, (that might be blurry Matt in the background?) and I’m super pregnant. I think these were on her tour of saying goodbye to the DMV area.
