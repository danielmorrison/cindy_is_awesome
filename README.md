# Cindy Is Awesome

And you can help remind her how awesome we all think she is!

## Setup

* This thing is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), so you'll need to install it. That's pretty easy.
* As of right now, we're using the Ananke theme, which is installed as a git submodule, so once you checkout this repo, you'll need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the directory.
* Once you've install hugo and fetched the theme, you can see things by running `huge serve -D`.
